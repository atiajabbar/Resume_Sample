# Resume_Sample

I have created a simple HTML/CSS website as a Resume Sample which is mainly based on HTML and 30 to 40% CSS.
It is based on pure coding.

A single-page resume template mainly based on HTML & CSS.

Compatibility and Known Issues/Limitations
I have only tested this project on latest release version of Firefox (56 as of writing) and Google Chrome (61) on macOS 10.13 (High Sierra).
It's my intention to support other browsers/platforms (like IE Edge on Windows?) as long as the browser sufficiently supports the required CSS features: calc(), var(), flexbox, ...etc, and does not require (too many) dirty tricks. PRs or comments welcome!
No hyperlinking functionality in rendered PDF as browers's print-to-PDF process is merely "flattening to digital paper".
Other browser-specific hacks are as commented in the code.
